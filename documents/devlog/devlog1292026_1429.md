## Accomplished Milestones

### ✅ Core Infrastructure Established

**Timestamp: 14:29 — Project Initialization Complete**

The Next.js 16.1.6 application framework has been successfully scaffolded with a modern, production-ready configuration:

- **Framework:** Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router and Turbopack bundler
- **Runtime:** React 19.2.3 with native View Transitions API support
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript 5.x fully configured and operational
- **Styling Foundation:** Tailwind CSS 4.x with OKLCH color engine
- **Animation Library:** Framer Motion 12.29.2 for advanced choreography
- **Utilities:** clsx 2.1.1 and tailwind-merge 3.4.0 for class management

All dependencies have been installed and verified. The development server is running smoothly at `http://localhost:3000` with zero compilation errors or warnings.

### Design Philosophy Locked

**Timestamp: 14:29 — Aesthetic Direction Defined**

The visual identity for Mycelia Interactive™ has been architected with careful consideration of contrast and cinematic impact:

**Brand Colors:**
- Teal/Cyan (#00CED1 range) + Gold/Orange (#FFB84D range)

**Hero Section Palette (Contrasting Scheme):**
- Primary Background: Deep Purple/Violet (#1a0b2e → #2d1b4e)
- Primary Accent: Electric Pink/Magenta (#FF10F0 → #E535AB)
- Secondary Accent: Icy Blue (#00F5FF → #4DFFFF)
- Text/Highlights: Pure White (#FFFFFF)

This chromatic separation ensures the brand identity remains distinct from the hero section's storytelling environment—a critical consideration for maintaining visual coherence across interactive transitions.

### Project Architecture Defined

**Timestamp: 14:29 — Development Roadmap Established**

The development pipeline has been structured into discrete phases, each with measurable outcomes:

**Current Phase:** 1.1 (Initialization) — **COMPLETE**
**Next Phase:** 1.2 (Tailwind CSS 4.0 Configuration)

| Phase | Component | Status | Target Date |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1.2 | Tailwind CSS 4.0 Theme Configuration | Pending | Q1 2026 |
| 1.3 | TypeScript & Project Structure Setup | Pending | Q1 2026 |
| 1.4 | Global Styles & CSS Variables | Pending | Q1 2026 |
| 2.1 | Hero Component Container | Pending | Q1 2026 |
| 2.2 | Responsive Grid Layout | Pending | Q1 2026 |
| 2.3 | Typography Hierarchy | Pending | Q1 2026 |
| 2.4 | Brand Logo Integration | Pending | Q1 2026 |

## Project Vision: Interactive Cinema

Mycelia Interactive™ represents a convergence of cinema and interactivity. The platform will feature:

1. **Split-Screen Branching Effect** (Interaction #1) — Left/right panes with hover and scroll triggers, creating a visual metaphor for narrative divergence
2. **Glitch Aesthetic Transitions** (Interaction #2) — Reality distortion and VHS-inspired effects applied to headline elements, suggesting alternate timelines
3. **Mycelia-Inspired Background** — Canvas-based animated node network connections, referencing the interconnected nature of fungal networks and narrative branches
4. **Cinematic Hero Section** — Full-viewport immersive entry point combining all aesthetic and interactive elements

**Target Audience:** Viewers seeking immersive, choice-driven entertainment experiences; audiences who crave narrative depth and interactive control; consumers of branching narratives and alternate reality storytelling.

---

## Next Steps: Phase 1.2 — Configuration

The immediate roadmap focuses on translating the design philosophy into technical implementation:

1. **Configure Tailwind CSS 4.0** with OKLCH color tokens
2. **Define CSS variables** in global styles for the hero palette
3. **Enable advanced CSS features:** container queries, custom properties, animation utilities
4. **Establish typography hierarchy** with Google Fonts or system font stack
5. **Create reusable animation utilities** for glitch, split-screen, and fade effects
